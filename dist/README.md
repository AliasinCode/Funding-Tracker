# Assets Directory

This directory contains application assets like icons.

## Icon Requirements

To set a custom application icon:

1. **Create an icon file** named `icon.png` in this directory
2. **Recommended size**: 256x256 pixels or larger
3. **Format**: PNG is recommended for best compatibility
4. **Build the project**: `npm run build` (this will copy the icon to dist/assets/)

## Current Status

- No icon file is currently present
- The application will use the default Electron icon until you add one

## How to Add Your Icon

1. Create or obtain a PNG icon file (256x256 or larger)
2. Name it `icon.png`
3. Place it in this directory
4. Run `npm run build`
5. Restart the application with `npm start`
